    <p>
        I studied design in college and started working as a designer after graduation. I worked on a multitude of projects for clients of all sizes. After
        <mark class="inline-block px-1 text-gray-50 bg-red-500 rotate-1">
            <span class="inline-block -rotate-1">more than 20 years,</span>
        </mark>
        I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as I used to. I accomplished a lot, including being able to do package design for a Star Wars licensed product.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fortunately while in college, one of my professors introduced me to HTML, enforcing the importance of learning to hand code, and not rely on tools to build for you â€“ which at the time was
        <mark class="inline-block px-1 text-gray-50 bg-red-500 -rotate-3">
            <span class="inline-block rotate-3">FrontPage.</span>
        </mark>
    </p>

    <p>
        I found quickly that I enjoyed writing code, and was one of few designers that could also code. Not only did I know HTML &amp; CSS, but soon picked up PHP and JavaScript as well as SQL, database and server management. I'm fortunate to be able to choose between careers, and was able to pivot to development only quite easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        I still enjoy designing for myself, but for the most part,
        <mark class="inline px-1 text-gray-50 bg-red-500">I'm no longer taking on client design work.</mark>

        For 10 years I worked as designer, then Creative Director of Alara Creative, a bespoke marketing firm. I was able to work with a variety of clients on a myriad of projects.
        Here are a few of my favorite from over the years:
