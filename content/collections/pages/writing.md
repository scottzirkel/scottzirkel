### Writing
 I often throw a few words up on Medium when the occasion presents itself. Here's a few I like.

- [A Year with Tailwind](https://medium.com/alara-creative/a-year-with-tailwind-92f420b2f8b9)  
My continuing adventures with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Spoiler: _I love it._
- [Random Chapter](https://medium.com/@scottzirkel/authors-note-the-following-is-a-sample-chapter-from-the-book-i-am-currently-working-on-88e7ababb55c)  
or, _The One Where She Goes to the Bar_
- [The Fultilment of the Jedi Order](https://medium.com/@scottzirkel/the-fulfilment-of-the-jedi-order-d89a6a8fdbf1)  
or, _Yet Another Idiot Comparing Star Wars to the Bible_
