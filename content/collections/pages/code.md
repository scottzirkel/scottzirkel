I primarily use Laravel, a PHP framework. I'm currently enhancing that with the following hotness: 
- [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com)/[Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com)/[AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

99% of my code is private client work, but I try to save some of my non-client work on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottzirkel). You can also see me trying new things at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/scottzirkel).
