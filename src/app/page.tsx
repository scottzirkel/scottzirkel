        Hey gang, I'm Scott and this is my site (obviously). I'm an artist, a
        programmer, a writer, a designer, a father, a husband, a Jeeper, an
        overlander, and probably other things I've forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got a few drawings, some writing, and other things scattered
        throughout the site and across various social media platforms. I do hope
        you find something you enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks, Scott</p>
