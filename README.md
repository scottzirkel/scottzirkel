Hey gang, I'm Scott and this is my repo (obviously). I'm an artist, a programmer, a writer, a designer, a father, a husband, a Jeeper, [an overlander](https://instagram.com/parttimeoverland), and probably other things I've forgotten.

I've got a few drawings, some writing, and other things scattered throughout the site and across various social media platforms. I do hope you find something you enjoy.
